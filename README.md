## Description

CanvasHack is a Chrome browser extension designed to bypass Canvas's built-in quiz activity tracking. It hides tab switches, window changes, split-screen usage, background activity, and other actions that would normally appear in the Canvas quiz logs as suspicious (e.g., "Left quiz tab", "Stopped viewing the Canvas quiz-taking page").


### Key Features

- **Undetectable tab & window switching** — Flip between tabs or apps freely; Canvas sees only normal quiz activity.
- **No suspicious logs** — Blocks or spoofs visibility events so "Left quiz tab" or "Stopped viewing" never appears.
- **Answer saving & smart second attempts** — Remembers your best answers across attempts and auto-fills them for higher scores.
- **Kiosk mode spoofing** — Makes the quiz appear locked/secure on the surface while you retain full browser freedom.
- **Seamless & lightweight** — Easy one-click install, no performance impact.
- **Works on all Canvas domains** — Compatible with school, university, and institution Canvas instances.
- **Live real-exam demos available** — Watch proof videos showing clean logs vs. flagged logs.

## 📚 Personal Research

While using this extension and the CanvasHack extension, I had made a couple of observations.

- It tends to break other websites while interferring with certain elements outside of canvas which can be mildly annoying at times.
- All this extension really does is intercept client-sent network requests and block them. That's literally it outside of the answer saving feature which can be useful.
- Upon reviewing the code initially, I came to the strong suspicion a large amount of the programming that went into it was manufactured by AI, or in other words "vibe-coded"
- A monthly subscription for this service is pretty insane considering what it does. But the market's demands for a product can be irrational so kudos.

  **PERSONAL CHANGE TO THE CODE** - I added a kill switch to the extension, so at any time of my choosing should I deem it fit, CanvasCracked will cease working. (Implemented to the best of my ability, obviously a developer who is dedicated enough COULD reverse engineer the obfuscation I added to protect this kill switch, but I wish them good luck in breaking that obfuscation.
